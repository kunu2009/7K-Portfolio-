# The Evolution of Somaiya Timings — A Funny Timeline

There's regular time. There's Indian Standard Time.

And then there's **Somaiya Time**.

A strange dimension where 8:00 AM means "should have left 20 minutes ago," where 10-minute breaks last 45 minutes, and where "just 5 more minutes" has no relationship to actual minutes.

Here's the complete timeline of a Somaiya student's relationship with time.

---

## 5:30 AM — The Optimistic Alarm

You set this alarm with pure intentions.

**What you imagined:** Wake up refreshed. Morning workout. Healthy breakfast. Review yesterday's notes. Arrive early. Front bench. Teacher's respect.

**What happens:** Phone thrown across room. Back to sleep. No memory of alarm existing.

---

## 6:00 AM — The Backup Alarm

The second alarm. The safety net.

You knew the 5:30 wouldn't work. That's why you set this one.

**Status:** Also ignored.

---

## 6:30 AM — The "This One Is Real" Alarm

Okay, this is the actual wake-up alarm. The previous ones were... aspirational.

**What happens:** One eye opens. Brain calculates: "If I skip breakfast and take an auto instead of bus, I can sleep 20 more minutes."

Decision made. Back to sleep.

---

## 6:50 AM — The Panic Alarm

This alarm has a different ringtone. A more aggressive one.

This is when you actually start processing reality:
- You're horizontal
- You should be vertical
- Time is not on your side

**The negotiation:** "I can skip the shower. I showered yesterday. That counts."

---

## 7:00 AM — The "I'm Definitely Late" Realization

You're moving now. But with chaos energy:
- Toothbrush in mouth while finding clothes
- Bag being packed while trying to remember what day it is
- Keys nowhere to be found
- Phone at 23% battery

**Internal monologue:** "Maybe there's traffic and the lecture starts late."

---

## 7:30 AM — The Commute

Whether it's bus, train, or auto — this is calculation time:

- "If we hit two more green lights..."
- "If the teacher is also running late..."
- "If I enter from the back door..."

**Phone activity:** Texting friends: "Save a seat" or "Did they take attendance yet?"

---

## 7:55 AM — The Campus Sprint

You're here. You're not in class. These 5 minutes determine everything.

**The speed run:**
- Skip the elevator (full or slow)
- Stairs: two at a time
- Corridor: controlled jog
- Door: quiet entry attempted

---

## 8:00 AM — The Attendance Moment

The teacher's eyes scan the room.

**If you made it:** Silent victory. Slide into seat. Act like you've been there for hours.

**If you didn't:** The eternal question: "Excuse me sir, can I come in?"

**Teacher's response options:**
1. "Yes, come." (Relief)
2. "Stand outside for 10 minutes." (Embarrassment)
3. *Silent stare* (Interpretation required)

---

## 8:05 AM — The "Brain Not Yet Online" Phase

You're physically present. Mentally, you're still in bed.

**Activities:**
- Staring at board with zero comprehension
- Nodding at random intervals
- Drawing in margins
- Counting ceiling tiles

---

## 9:00 AM — First Break (Sort Of)

The lecture ends. You have 10 minutes.

**What 10 minutes means:**
- Walk to canteen: 3 min
- Wait in line: 4 min
- Eat/drink: 2 min
- Walk back: 3 min

**Total:** 12 minutes minimum

**Reality:** You're late to the next lecture too.

---

## 10:30 AM — The Peak Productivity Illusion

This is when you feel most awake and think:

"I should use my time better. From tomorrow, I'll wake up early and study regularly."

**Status:** This thought occurs every day. Implementation: never.

---

## 11:00 AM — The Pre-Lunch Hunger

The stomach starts making sounds that echo in the quiet lecture hall.

**Internal dialogue:**
- "Is it weird if I eat now?"
- "Does this biscuit rustle too loud?"
- "How long until lunch break?"

**Answer:** Too long. Always too long.

---

## 12:30 PM — Lunch Break

The official break. Finally.

**The rush:**
- Everyone moves at once
- Canteen lines form instantly
- Seats become premium real estate
- Time moves faster than any other hour

**Reality of a 45-minute lunch break:**
- First 15 min: Getting food
- Next 15 min: Eating
- Last 15 min: "Bro, we have to go back"
- Actually returning: 10 minutes late

---

## 1:00 PM — The Post-Lunch Coma

The most dangerous hour for any student.

**Symptoms:**
- Heavy eyelids
- Comfortable seat suddenly too comfortable
- Professor's voice becoming white noise
- Detailed notes becoming scribbles

**The Fighter:** Uses phone brightness as eye stimulus
**The Surrenderer:** Accepts fate, rests head on bag
**The Strategist:** Uses this lecture to catch up on sleep for tonight's studying

---

## 2:30 PM — The "Time Has Stopped" Feeling

You check the time. It's 2:30.

You attend what feels like an entire lecture.

You check the time again. It's 2:35.

**Conclusion:** The afternoon lectures exist in a time vortex.

---

## 3:30 PM — The Energy Return

Suddenly, inexplicably, energy returns.

**Because:**
- End of the day is near
- Plans for evening are forming
- The will to live returns

**Group chat activity increases:** "What's the plan after college?"

---

## 4:00 PM — The Rush to Leave

Last lecture ends. The migration begins.

**Everyone's calculation:**
- "If I run, I'll catch the first bus"
- "The canteen will be empty now"
- "I can still do [evening activity] if I leave now"

**The actual leaving process:** Takes 30 minutes of "okay, let's go... okay wait... okay now let's go"

---

## 5:00 PM — The "I'll Be Productive Today" Declaration

On the way home or at home, the resolution forms:

"Today I'll actually study. I'll make notes. I'll complete that assignment. I'll be different."

**Chances of execution:** Approximately 15%.

---

## 6:00 PM — The "Just 30 Minutes of Rest" Trap

You lie down. Just to rest your eyes. Just for a moment.

**Intention:** 30-minute power nap

**Reality:** Wake up at 9 PM confused about what year it is

---

## 7:30 PM — The Evening Plans That Changed

Original plan: Study from 7 PM onwards

Actual activity at 7:30 PM:
- Scrolling phone
- "Quick" YouTube video
- One more episode
- Dinner
- More scrolling
- Guilt

---

## 9:00 PM — The "I Should Start" Awareness

The realization hits that nothing has been done.

**The bargaining:** "If I start now and study until 12, that's 3 hours. That's a lot!"

**Reality check:** You haven't studied 3 hours consecutively since... when?

---

## 10:00 PM — The Actual Study Start

Finally. Books open. Notes out. Ready to go.

**First 15 minutes:** Productive

**Minutes 16-30:** Phone check. "Just one message."

**Minutes 31-45:** Lost in Instagram

**Minutes 46-60:** "Okay, focus now."

**Repeat cycle until midnight.**

---

## 11:00 PM — The Philosophical Hour

Studying slows. Mind wanders.

**Questions that arise:**
- "What am I even doing with my life?"
- "Why did I choose this field?"
- "What is the point of this syllabus?"
- "Is this worth it?"

**Duration:** 20 minutes

**Outcome:** No answers, but feels profound

---

## 12:00 AM — The Fork in the Road

**Option A:** "I've done enough. Tomorrow is another day."
*Leads to:* Sleep, wake up late, repeat cycle

**Option B:** "I'll finish this chapter if it kills me."
*Leads to:* 2 AM, diminishing returns, zombie next day

**Option C:** "Let me just set a 5:30 alarm and study in the morning."
*Leads to:* Optimism, ignored alarms, history repeating

---

## 1:00 AM — The Overtired Energy

If you're still awake, a strange thing happens: you get a second wind.

**Activities:**
- Actually focused studying
- Random deep cleaning of room
- Life planning sessions
- Philosophical texts with friends

**Tomorrow's regret level:** High

---

## 2:00 AM — The Surrender

Eyes can't stay open. Brain refuses new information.

**The justification:** "I've covered the important stuff. Whatever I don't know now, I won't know tomorrow either."

**Sleep quality:** Poor, but necessary

---

## 5:30 AM — The Cycle Restarts

The alarm rings.

You set this alarm with pure intentions.

And so it continues.

---

## Special Time Events

### The Exam Day Timeline

- **Night before:** "I'll sleep early"
- **Reality:** Studying until 3 AM
- **Exam day morning:** Somehow running late despite being awake since 5
- **During exam:** Time moves too fast for questions you know, too slow for questions you don't
- **After exam:** "That wasn't that bad" or "I'm dropping out"

### The Submission Deadline Timeline

- **2 weeks before deadline:** "Plenty of time"
- **1 week before:** "Should probably start"
- **3 days before:** "This weekend for sure"
- **Day before:** "All-nighter it is"
- **4 hours before:** Peak performance unlocked
- **30 minutes before:** Formatting issues, file won't upload
- **5 minutes before:** Somehow submitted

### The Event Day Timeline

- **Event at 5 PM:** "I have the whole day"
- **12 PM:** "Still time"
- **3 PM:** "Should probably get ready"
- **4:30 PM:** Running around, nothing is ready
- **5:15 PM:** "We're fashionably late"

## Conclusion: Time Is Just a Construct (At Somaiya)

Here's what you learn at Somaiya about time:

1. **Your relationship with alarms** will always be adversarial
2. **"5 minutes"** is not a measurement but a feeling
3. **Peak productivity** happens at 11 PM or during deadlines
4. **The afternoon** is a temporal anomaly
5. **Morning plans** made at night are fantasies

But somehow, despite all of this:
- Attendance gets maintained (barely)
- Assignments get submitted (somehow)
- Exams get passed (mostly)
- You survive

Maybe Somaiya Time isn't broken.

Maybe it's the only time system that actually accounts for human nature.
