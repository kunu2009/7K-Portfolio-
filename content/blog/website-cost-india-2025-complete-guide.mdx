## Money-Saving Tips {#money-saving-tips}

### 1. Start with MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Launch with essential features only. Add advanced features later based on user feedback.

**Example:** Instead of building full e-commerce (₹1,20,000), start with a catalog website + WhatsApp ordering (₹30,000). Upgrade later.

**Potential Savings:** 40-60%

### 2. Use Open-Source Platforms
WordPress, Ghost, and other open-source platforms save development time and cost.

**Savings:** ₹20,000 - ₹50,000 compared to custom-built solutions

### 3. Provide Your Own Content
Professional copywriting costs ₹500-1,500 per page. Write your own content (even rough drafts) and have the developer polish it.

**Savings:** ₹10,000 - ₹50,000

### 4. Use Free Tools Where Possible
- **Free SSL:** Let's Encrypt
- **Free Email (small scale):** Zoho Free (5 users)
- **Free Analytics:** Google Analytics
- **Free Images:** Unsplash, Pexels

**Savings:** ₹10,000 - ₹30,000/year

### 5. Bundle Services
Many developers offer discounts for package deals (website + hosting + maintenance).

**Savings:** 10-20% off total cost

### 6. Pay Annually Instead of Monthly
Hosting, email, and software subscriptions are cheaper when paid annually.

**Savings:** 15-30% on recurring costs

### 7. Negotiate Fixed-Price Contracts
Hourly billing can spiral out of control. Get a fixed-price quote with clear deliverables.

**Savings:** 20-40% vs hourly billing

### 8. Request Multiple Quotes
Get quotes from 3-5 developers/agencies. Use the best features from each to negotiate.

**Savings:** 15-25% through competitive quotes

### 9. Do Your Own Testing
Instead of paying for QA, test the website yourself and provide specific feedback.

**Savings:** ₹5,000 - ₹15,000

### 10. Use Template Customization
Instead of fully custom design, start with a premium template and customize it.

**Savings:** ₹15,000 - ₹40,000 on design costs

**💡 Total Potential Savings:** ₹50,000 - ₹2,00,000 by combining these strategies

3. "What's NOT included?" (Identify hidden costs)
4. "What happens if I need changes after launch?"
5. "Who owns the code and design after payment?"

10. "Can you provide 2-3 client references?"

### Step 6: Get Everything in Writing

Your contract should include:
- Detailed scope of work
- Timeline with milestones
- Payment schedule

### Technical Questions

**Q: What's better - WordPress or custom coding?**

A: Depends on your needs:

**Choose WordPress if:**
- Budget under ₹50,000
- Need to update content yourself
- Want to add features via plugins
- Don't need unique functionality
- Want quick launch (1-2 weeks)

**Choose custom coding if:**
- Budget over ₹1,00,000
- Need unique features
- Require high performance
- Want full control
- Building a web application

**Performance comparison:** Custom-coded sites load 30-50% faster than WordPress on average. [Source: WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)

**Q: Will my website work on all devices?**

A: Yes, if built properly. All modern websites should be responsive (adapt to screen size).

Test on these before launch:
- iPhone (Safari)
- Android (Chrome)
- Desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Tablet (iPad)

**Q: How fast should my website load?**

A: **Under 3 seconds** on mobile, according to [Google's research](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/). 

53% of mobile users abandon sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load.

**Target scores:**
- Google PageSpeed: 90+
- GTmetrix: A grade
- Core Web Vitals: All green

**Q: Do I need a mobile app too?**

A: For most businesses, **no**. A responsive website covers 90% of use cases.

**Build a mobile app if:**
- Need offline functionality
- Require push notifications
- Want app store presence
- Need device features (camera, GPS, etc.)
- Have budget (₹1,50,000+ per platform)

**Alternative:** Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) give app-like experience through browsers at 70% lower cost.

## Conclusion: What Should YOU Pay?

Here's my honest recommendation based on 5+ years in web development:

**If you're just starting:**
Begin with ₹15,000-30,000 for a solid professional website. This gives you credibility without breaking the bank. You can always add features later.

**If you're established:**
Invest ₹60,000-1,00,000 for a website that truly represents your brand and generates leads. This is a business asset, not an expense.

**If you're building a product:**
Budget ₹2,00,000+ and expect 3-6 months of development. Don't cut corners on your core product.

**Remember:**
- Cheap websites often cost more long-term (fixes, redesigns)
- Expensive doesn't always mean better (ask for portfolio proof)
- The right price is what delivers ROI for YOUR business
