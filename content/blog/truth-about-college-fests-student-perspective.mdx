- Eventually: "I'll lead this"

## Advice for Future Fest Organizers

### Before You Join

1. **Know the time commitment** (it's more than they say)
2. **Understand the work** (it's not just attending events)
3. **Check your academics** (can you afford to fall behind?)
4. **Know your team** (who actually works?)

### During Fest Prep

1. **Document everything** (budgets, decisions, contacts)
2. **Build redundancy** (backup for every critical thing)
3. **Sleep when you can** (it compounds)
4. **Eat properly** (energy is real)
5. **Communicate over-clearly** (assumptions kill)

### During the Fest

1. **Stay calm** (panic spreads faster than solutions)
2. **Delegate** (you can't do everything)
3. **Trust your team** (even when worried)
4. **Handle crises quietly** (attendees shouldn't know)
5. **Take photos** (you'll want them)

### After the Fest

1. **Rest first** (then assess)
2. **Do post-mortem** (learn for next year)
3. **Thank everyone** (genuinely)
4. **Close finances** (vendors waiting)
5. **Document learnings** (for successors)

## Conclusion: The Beautiful Chaos

College fests are objectively insane undertakings. Students with no event management experience somehow pull off multi-day festivals with celebrities, thousands of attendees, and dozens of events.

It's stressful. It's exhausting. It's chaotic.

And it's one of the most formative experiences of college life.

The fest you see on Instagram is the polished version. The real fest is made of sleepless nights, crisis management, and people pushing through anyway.

So the next time you attend a college fest, remember: somewhere behind that stage, a group of students who haven't slept in 48 hours are holding everything together with caffeine and determination.

Appreciate them. They're doing something remarkable.

*The best college fests aren't defined by the celebrity. They're defined by the team that didn't give up.*
