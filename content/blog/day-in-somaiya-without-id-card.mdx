# A Day in Somaiya Without Your ID Card — What Actually Happens

**7:45 AM. You're running late. Bag? Check. Laptop? Check. Bottle? Check. ID Card?**

*Searches bag frantically*

*Searches again*

*Heart rate increases*

**ID Card?!**

And just like that, your entire day is about to become an adventure you never asked for. 🎢

Welcome to the most relatable experience for any Somaiya student—surviving a day without your ID card. Whether you forgot it at home, lost it in the depths of your hostel room, or left it in yesterday's jeans (classic move), here's exactly what you're about to face.

---

## 📍 Chapter 1: The Gate 3 Standoff (8:00 AM)

You approach Gate 3 with the confidence of someone who *definitely* has their ID card. The security guard watches you. You watch the security guard.

### The Negotiation Phase

**You**: *pretends to search bag* "Bhaiya, aaj bhool gaya..."

**Guard**: *unmoved* "Entry card lao"

**You**: "Sir please, class hai 8:15 ko..."

**Guard**: "Koi baat nahi, pehle card lao"

### What Actually Works (Sometimes):

| Strategy | Success Rate | Risk Level |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| College ID photo on phone | 20% | Low |
| Show Aadhar/PAN card | 5% | Medium |
| Call a friend inside | 40% | Low |
| Wait for a crowd and slip in | 60% | HIGH 😅 |
| Cry (not recommended) | 0% | Your dignity |

### The Parent Card Call

If nothing works, you make THE call.

*Ring ring*

**You**: "Dad... I forgot my ID card. Can you bring it?"

**Dad**: "Beta, tumhe kitni baar bola..."

**You**: (internally dies for the next 45 minutes waiting)

---

## 📚 Chapter 2: The Library Lockout

Somehow you made it inside. Victory! But wait—your assignment is due, and you need to access the library computer, or worse, borrow a reference book.

### Management Library (Ground Floor Nightmare)

You approach the scanner. The librarian looks at you. You look at the scanner.

**You**: "Ma'am, ID bhool gaya..."

**Librarian**: "Register mein entry karo"

Ah yes, the **sacred register**—where your shame is documented for eternity.

```
DATE        | NAME           | REASON      | TIME IN | TIME OUT
------------|----------------|-------------|---------|----------
01/12/2024  | [Your Name]    | ID FORGOT   | 10:15   | 
01/12/2024  | [Your Name]    | ID FORGOT   | 10:17   | 10:18
(You left because the computer was taken)
```

### Aurobindo Library (The Stricter One)

**Librarian**: "ID?"

**You**: "Ma'am actually..."

**Librarian**: "No ID, no entry."

**You**: "But ma'am, I just need to—"

**Librarian**: "Next."

Aurobindo doesn't negotiate. Aurobindo doesn't care about your assignment deadline. Aurobindo follows *rules*.

## 🍽️ Chapter 3: Canteen Cash Crisis

Plot twist: Your ID card is also how you access the prepaid canteen system (if your college uses it) or proves you're a student for student discounts.

### The Canteen Dilemma

Without your ID, you're just... a random person. A random person who wants a ₹30 vada pav.

**Canteen uncle**: "Student ho?"

**You**: *shows college bag, textbook, dark circles under eyes*

**Uncle**: "ID dikhao"

**You**: ...

Sometimes the uniform saves you. Sometimes it doesn't.

### Pro Tip: The UPI Backup

Most Somaiya students have learned: always have UPI ready. No ID? No problem—just scan and pay like a civilized 2024 human.

---

## 😰 Chapter 4: The Attendance Anxiety

Now comes the real stress—attendance.

### Scenario A: The Biometric Classroom

Some departments have biometric attendance. No ID, no fingerprint, no problem... wait, actually big problem.

**Options:**
1. Beg the professor to mark you present manually
2. Get a friend to say "proxy dena" (we don't endorse this)
3. Accept your fate

### Scenario B: The Roll Call

**Professor**: "Roll number 47?"

**You**: "Present sir!"

**Professor**: "ID card dikhao."

**You**: *soul leaves body*

### Scenario C: The Cool Professor

**Professor**: "ID bhul gaye? Koi baat nahi, next time mat bhoolna."

**You**: *tears of gratitude*

These professors are rare. Treasure them.

## 🏃 Chapter 5: The Multi-Building Marathon

Somaiya is SPREAD OUT. And if you need to go between buildings—Vidyavihar to Ghatkopar campus, or even just between blocks—prepare for chaos.

### The Internal Gates

Some internal areas between departments have their own checks.

**Security**: "ID?"

**You**: (for the 17th time today) "Bhul gaya sir..."

**Security**: "Which department?"

**You**: "IT, sir"

**Security**: *looks at you suspiciously* "IT building udhar hai"

**You**: "I know sir, I study here..."

---

## 😤 Chapter 6: The "I Know Your Face" False Hope

After a few months of college, you start thinking:

*"Security uncle knows me now. I'm basically famous. He'll let me in."*

**Reality check**: They process 3,000+ students daily. They do NOT remember your face. Your face is not special. (Sorry.)

### The Exception

The ONLY exception is if you're:
- A faculty member (obviously)
- An extremely problematic student (they remember the troublemakers)
- The NSS/Cultural fest volunteer who's been running around for weeks

## 🆘 Chapter 7: Emergency Survival Guide

Okay, real talk. If you're reading this AND currently ID-less, here's your survival guide:

### Immediate Actions

1. **Check EVERYWHERE**
   - All bag pockets (even the secret ones)
   - Laptop sleeve
   - Jacket pockets
   - Did you keep it in your book?

2. **Phone backup photos**
   - If you have a clear photo of your ID, keep it handy
   - Some guards accept it, some don't

3. **Friend network activation**
   - WhatsApp group: "Anyone near Gate 3? Need rescue 😭"
   - Works 70% of the time

### Long-term Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Keep forgetting ID | Keep one in bag PERMANENTLY |
| Lost ID | Apply for duplicate ASAP (Admin Office) |
| Damaged ID | Get replacement before it stops working |
| Multiple IDs needed | Lanyard around neck = never forget |

### The Lanyard Life

Real talk: The students who wear their ID on a lanyard around their neck? They're the smart ones. Yes, it's not *aesthetic*. But neither is standing outside Gate 3 for 45 minutes.

## 😂 Chapter 8: Real Stories from Somaiya Students

*Names changed to protect the forgetful.*

### Story 1: The Hostel Walk of Shame

## 🧠 The Psychology of Forgetting

Why do we keep forgetting the ONE thing we need every single day?

### The Science

1. **Morning Rush**: Your brain prioritizes "don't miss the train" over "grab ID"
2. **False Security**: You've made it without ID before, brain thinks it's optional
3. **Location Blind Spot**: ID is always in the "same place"... until it isn't
4. **The Monday Effect**: Weekends reset your brain's autopilot

### The Solution (For Real)

**Make it physically impossible to forget:**

```
DOOR → ID HOOK → KEYS
        ↓
    CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT IT
```

Put your ID where you HAVE to see it—on your keys, on your main bag, on the door handle.

## 📱 The Future: Digital ID Cards?

Somaiya is slowly modernizing. Some possibilities for the future:

- **App-based ID**: Scan QR code from phone
- **NFC in phones**: Tap your phone instead of card
- **Biometric-only**: Face recognition (like some other colleges)
- **Blockchain ID**: Okay maybe not this far

Until then, **don't forget your card.**

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Your ID card is your passport** to everything in Somaiya
2. **Gate 3 guards have seen every excuse** in the book
3. **Librarians don't negotiate**
4. **Always have a backup plan** (friend, phone photo, UPI)
5. **The lanyard life is the smart life**
6. **You're not alone** — literally everyone has been here

## Final Thoughts

Forgetting your ID card is a rite of passage at Somaiya. Everyone does it. The difference is whether you do it once and learn, or become a regular feature at the Gate 3 negotiation table.

But hey, at least now you know **exactly how that ID card works** (check out our [RFID technology article](/blog/how-somaiya-id-card-works-rfid-technology-explained))—even if you occasionally forget to bring it.

**Stay prepared, stay caffeinated, and never forget your ID.**

*Unless you want another story for the collection.* 😅
