## üé® UI Implementation Guide

### Recommended UI Pattern (WhatsApp-style)

```tsx
// Example React component
function ChatMessage({ response }) {
  return (
    <div className="chat-message">
      {/* Main answer */}
      <div className="answer">
        {response.answer}
      </div>
      
      {/* Follow-up suggestions */}
      {response.followUpQuestions && (
        <div className="follow-ups">
          <p className="follow-ups-label">üí° You might also want to know:</p>
          <div className="follow-up-buttons">
            {response.followUpQuestions.map((question, i) => (
              <button
                key={i}
                className="follow-up-btn"
                onClick={() => handleFollowUp(question)}
              >
                {question}
              </button>
            ))}
          </div>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Suggested Styling
```css
.follow-ups {
  margin-top: 16px;
  padding: 12px;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
  border-radius: 12px;
}

.follow-up-btn {
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 4px;
  padding: 8px 16px;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
  border: none;
  border-radius: 20px;
  color: white;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: transform 0.2s;
}

.follow-up-btn:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
}
```

### Swipe Interaction (Mobile)
```tsx
// Use swipe library like react-swipeable
import { useSwipeable } from 'react-swipeable';

function FollowUpCard({ questions }) {
  const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);
  
  const handlers = useSwipeable({
    onSwipedLeft: () => setCurrentIndex(prev => 
      Math.min(prev + 1, questions.length - 1)
    ),
    onSwipedRight: () => setCurrentIndex(prev => 
      Math.max(prev - 1, 0)
    ),
  });
  
  return (
    <div {...handlers} className="swipeable-card">
      <p>{questions[currentIndex]}</p>
      <div className="dots">
        {questions.map((_, i) => (
          <span key={i} className={i === currentIndex ? 'active' : ''} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üöÄ Testing

### Test Greetings
```javascript
// Test basic greetings
await askChatAssistant("hello");
await askChatAssistant("good morning");
await askChatAssistant("how are you");
await askChatAssistant("thanks");
await askChatAssistant("bye");
```

### Test Follow-Ups
```javascript
// Test follow-up questions
const response = await askChatAssistant("Who is Kunal?");
console.log(response.followUpQuestions);
// Expected: ["What is the 7K Ecosystem?", "What are Kunal's career plans?", ...]
```

### Test Fallback
```javascript
// Unknown question should still provide follow-ups
const response = await askChatAssistant("random unknown question");
console.log(response.followUpQuestions);
// Expected: ["Who is Kunal?", "What is 7K Ecosystem?", ...]
```

## üìä Statistics

- **Total Greetings**: 10 patterns
- **Total Q&A with Follow-Ups**: 6 (more can be added)
- **Follow-Ups per Question**: 3-5 suggestions
- **Priority Level**: 15 (greetings), 7-10 (Q&A)

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### To Add More Follow-Ups
1. Open `src/lib/stan-knowledge-base.ts`
2. Find the Q&A entry you want to enhance
3. Add `followUpQuestions: ["Question 1", "Question 2", ...]`
4. Test the response

### Example
```typescript
{
  keywords: ["polyglot"],
  patterns: [/what is 7k polyglot/i],
  answer: "7K Polyglot is a language learning app...",
  priority: 8,
  followUpQuestions: [ // ADD THIS
    "What languages can I learn?",
    "How does spaced repetition work?",
    "Is there a mobile app?",
    "Tell me about other educational apps"
  ]
}
```

## ‚ú® Best Practices

1. **Keep Follow-Ups Relevant** - Only suggest questions related to the current topic
2. **3-5 Suggestions** - Not too few, not too many
3. **Natural Language** - Write questions as users would ask them
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Start broad, then offer specific details
5. **Test Priority** - Ensure high-priority entries match first

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Follow-ups not showing?
- Check if `followUpQuestions` array is defined
- Verify the entry is being matched (check priority/patterns)
- Ensure UI component is rendering the follow-ups

### Wrong greeting matched?
- Check pattern regex for conflicts
- Verify priority is set to 15
- Test pattern matching with console logs

### UI not displaying properly?
- Check CSS styling for `.follow-ups` class
- Verify click handlers are connected
- Test responsive design on mobile
