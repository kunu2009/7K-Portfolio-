## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why Convert to Next.js Instead of Iframe?
**Pros of Next.js Conversion**:
- ✅ Better SEO (server-side rendering)
- ✅ Faster performance (optimized React)
- ✅ Consistent theme (dark/light mode)
- ✅ Shared navigation
- ✅ Better user experience (no iframe limitations)
- ✅ Easier maintenance

**Cons of Iframe Approach**:
- ❌ Poor SEO
- ❌ Slower loading
- ❌ Mobile responsiveness issues
- ❌ Separate styling/theme
- ❌ Navigation conflicts

**Decision**: ✅ Convert to Next.js components (best practice)

---

### Theme Integration
**Original 7K Studios Theme**:
- Primary: #13262f (Gable Green)
- Secondary: #17557b (Chathams Blue)
- Accent: #366e8d (Calypso)

**Your Portfolio Theme**:
- Uses CSS variables from Tailwind
- Dark/light mode support
- Primary/accent colors from theme

**Solution**: Services page uses your portfolio's Tailwind theme while maintaining visual identity through layout and structure.
