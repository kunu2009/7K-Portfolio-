## 🚨 Potential Obstacles & Solutions

### **Obstacle 1: "No one responds to my messages"**
```
Solution:
1. Personalize more (reference their specific business)
2. Try different time zones/times
3. Mix up channels (email, WhatsApp, LinkedIn)
4. Improve your opening line
5. Follow up 2-3 times
```

### **Obstacle 2: "People ask for discounts"**
```
Solution:
1. Use payment plan: ₹4000 now + ₹4000 later
2. Offer first 10 at 20% off, then stop discount
3. Bundle deal: 2 templates = 15% off both
4. Add value: free customization, free setup
```

### **Obstacle 3: "I get responses but they don't buy"**
```
Solution:
1. Give them free demo call (15 min)
2. Show exactly how it looks for their business
3. Explain savings vs. custom build
4. Send 2-3 follow-ups before giving up
5. Ask what their concern is (fear of buying)
```

### **Obstacle 4: "Templates aren't selling, should I pivot?"**
```
Solution: NO! Keep going for at least 30 days.
1. First sales take time (customer acquisition)
2. Once you get word-of-mouth, accelerates
3. Adjust messaging, not product
4. Increase outreach (70→100→150 contacts/week)
5. Be patient - typical sales cycle: 1-2 weeks
```
