**Owner:** Kunal Chheda

- **Upsell:** ₹1,499+ (1:1 setup session)

- 15 core sales × ₹799 average = **₹11,985**
- 4 sessions × ₹2,000 average = **₹8,000**
- **Total target: ~₹31,945**

---

## 4) Payment Plan (Important: You Are 17, India)

> This is practical guidance, not legal/tax advice. Rules can change; confirm with provider terms + guardian + CA.

### What this means for you
- Many payment gateways require **18+ and KYC** for account holder.
- Your **minor bank account** and **FamPay** can receive some transfers, but may not be ideal for automated business checkout/webhooks/payout compliance.
- Best path: use a **parent/guardian as legal account owner** for payment gateway + payouts.

### Recommended payment setup path

#### Phase 1 (start immediately, low-tech)
- Use **UPI payment link/QR** tied to guardian-controlled account.
- Buyer submits payment screenshot + email in a simple form.
- You manually deliver product by email/Drive/Notion link.
- Good for first 20–50 orders and validating demand.

#### Phase 2 (automated checkout)
- Open **Razorpay** account under eligible guardian/business details (as per their policy).
- Use payment pages/links or integrated checkout on your site.
- Add webhook-based auto-delivery (email with download link).
- Use your existing project’s payment architecture guidance (`PAYMENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md`) as implementation reference.

#### Phase 3 (scaling)
- Add GST/invoicing process if threshold/requirements apply.
- Add refund policy and terms page.
- Track conversion per product page.

### FamPay role
- Useful for personal receiving/spending and small testing flows.
- Not ideal as the core settlement layer for a scalable digital storefront.

---

## 5) Store + SEO Architecture (Linked to Portfolio)

Create commercial pages under portfolio so SEO authority helps sales:

- `/shop` → main store listing
- `/shop/portfolio-starter-kit`
- `/shop/prompt-pack-student-dev`
- `/shop/resume-website-bundle`
- `/shop/consulting-call`
- `/shop/success-stories` (later)
- `/shop/faq`
- `/shop/refund-policy`
- `/shop/terms`

### Internal linking plan
- Homepage hero CTA → `/shop`
- Every related app page links to matching product page
- Blog posts include contextual CTA blocks to product pages
- Product pages link back to case studies/apps to strengthen trust and SEO cluster

### Blog topics that convert
- “How to build a student portfolio that gets freelance clients”
- “Best prompt packs for students and devs (with examples)”
- “Next.js portfolio checklist for 2026”
- “How I built 7K ecosystem projects and what I learned”

---

## 6) Sales Funnel (Very Simple)

1. **Traffic:** SEO blog + social posts + portfolio visitors
2. **Lead magnet:** Free mini resource (e.g., 20 prompts PDF)
3. **Email capture:** get email before full download
4. **Offer:** ₹149–₹799 starter products
5. **Upsell:** 1:1 session or bundle upgrade
6. **Retention:** monthly updates for previous buyers

---

## 7) Product Delivery Stack

### Minimal stack (fast)
- Payment confirmation form (Google Form/Tally)
- Delivery through Drive + Gmail templates
- Customer sheet tracking (Notion/Google Sheets)

### Better stack (after validation)
- Razorpay checkout + webhook
- Auto email via Resend/SendGrid
- License/download link tracking

---

## 8) Exact 30-Day Execution Plan

### Week 1 — Offer design

### Week 2 — Store pages + SEO

---

## 9) Pricing + Offer Copy Framework

Use this formula on each product page:
- **Who it is for**
- **What problem it solves**
- **What exactly is included**
- **What result in what time**
- **Price + guarantee + support scope**

Example headline:
> “Launch your developer portfolio in 1 weekend with a ready Next.js starter kit (SEO-ready).”

---

- Terms and conditions
- Refund policy (clear conditions, e.g., 7-day only if no download or objective issue)

- Contact details

---

## 11) Risk Control Checklist

- Don’t promise unrealistic income/job guarantees.
- Don’t use copyrighted template assets without license.
- Keep proof of all transactions.
- Always disclose if product is a template, educational, or service.
- For tax/legal compliance, use guardian + CA guidance early.

---

## 12) KPI Dashboard (Track Weekly)

## 16) Your List Review: What To Keep for AI + Low Manual Work

You shared big lists (100+ ideas). Most are valid, but not all are good for your brand or low-effort operations.

### A. Final recommendation count
- **Total ideas reviewed:** 100+ style list
- **Good for your portfolio brand:** **~32**
- **Best for AI-first + low manual effort:** **18**
- **Launch immediately (Phase 1):** **6**

### B. Best 18 AI-first ideas (from your list + your brand fit)
1. Prompt packs (student/dev/productivity)
2. Resume templates + portfolio copy templates
3. Social media post templates (developer/student niche)
4. Ebook templates
5. Script templates (YouTube/short-form)
6. Icon packs (AI-generated + edited)
7. Background packs / texture packs
8. Digital sticker packs
9. Notion planner templates (study + project)

- Deliver files automatically after payment
- Send follow-up email + review request

---

## 18) Production Pipeline (Minimal Human Time)

### Per product workflow (target: 2–4 hours total)
1. **Research prompt (AI):** generate 50 product angles for one niche.
2. **Selection (you):** pick top 1 angle.
3. **Asset generation (AI):** generate 30–100 assets/templates.
4. **Quality filter (you + AI):** remove weak outputs.
5. **Packaging (AI):** create README, usage guide, preview copy.
6. **Listing content (AI):** SEO title, description, FAQ, tags.
7. **Publish (app):** create page under `/shop/[slug]`.
8. **Delivery automation (app):** payment success → email with download link.

### Simple tooling stack
- Content generation: ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude (choose one primary)
- Visual assets: Canva + AI tools
- Storefront: your existing Next.js portfolio
- Payments: UPI now, Razorpay later (guardian-compliant setup)
- Delivery: Google Drive or S3 + Resend/SendGrid
